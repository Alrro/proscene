Proscene provides classes to ease the creation of interactive 3D scenes in Processing.
Proscene has been pretty much inspired in the Qt's OpenGL libqglviewer library
(http://www.libqglviewer.com/). Proscene has a very similar functionality to that found
in libqglviewer provided through a similar API, giving a default interactivity to your
Processing scenes through the mouse and keyboard. Most of the examples found in this
release are implementations of the libqglviewer counterparts. Proscene provides seemless
integration with Processing: Its API has been designed to fit that of Processing and
its implementation has been optimized to work along side with it. One of Proscene main
implementation goals was to keep it independent of the underlying Processing 3D renderer.
It has been tested with the OPENGL, P3D and GLGRAPHICS renderers and can properly work
with any of them.
 
Many thanks to Gilles Debunne for releasing his fantastic libqglviewer as free software.
Many thanks to Andres Colubri for all his thorough suggestions regarding the development
of Proscene and for redistributing this release along side his fantastic GLGraphics
package (http://users.design.ucla.edu/~acolubri/processing/glgraphics/home/index.html).
