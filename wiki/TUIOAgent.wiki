|| Requirements: [https://processing.org/download/ Processing >= 2.x], and the [http://otrolado.info/tersehandling.zip TerseHandling library] (source code found under the "*examples*" section of the library package ||

We are happy to offer this new example in collaboration with [http://edumo.net/wp/ Edumo], whom we are very grateful. This example additionally requires:

|| Extra-requirements: 1. [http://www.tuio.org/?processing TUIO Processing client] and, 2. [https://code.google.com/p/tuiodroid/ tuiodroid] (if have an Android enable device) and/or a [http://www.tuio.org/?software tuiosimulator] (if you don't)||

This example shows how to plug-in, and setup a touch device allowing to select and control the circles in our [ActionDrivenCallback  previous example]. To make it more interesting, we will allow concurrent finger control of the circles, so that various circles can be manipulated with different fingers at the same time. We will also keep the mouse agent intact, so that we can also manipulate the circles as we have done it with the mouse so far. This examples requires the [http://www.tuio.org/?processing TUIO Processing client] and, either a TUIO tracker such as [https://code.google.com/p/tuiodroid/ android's] (if have an Android enable device) and/or a [http://www.tuio.org/?software TUIO simulator] (if you don't), to send TUIO messages from.

To implement this setup we will:

  # Implement a TUIOAgent.
  # Register the tuioAgent by updating our scene setup.
