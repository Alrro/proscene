= Introduction =

`TerseHandling` is a framework designed to _sketching_ generic input events, i.e., transforming software or hardware input events into high-level user-defined actions, mainly implemented using [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generics_in_Java generic programming] techniques. It provides its own set of events which supports up to [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degrees_of_freedom_(mechanics) 6-DOFs], together with a set of *agents* which parse them, i.e., identify object *grabbers* and the *actions* they should perform, allowing the developer to focus on implementing those actions. A developer workflow using `TerseHandling` would typically involve the following tasks:

  * Reduce (hardware or software) input events: transform inputs event into their `TerseHandling` counterparts.
  * Choose a callback mechanism: a. direct actionless approach (no generic programming involve here); or, b. high-level action-driven (which extensively uses generic programming). In the latter case:
    * Define *shortcuts* over `TerseHandling` events to trigger actions.
    * Implement the actions to be performed by object grabbers.

`TerseHandling` is a full-fledged, stand-alone library which is expected to become the new event backend for the upcoming Procene-2 series.
