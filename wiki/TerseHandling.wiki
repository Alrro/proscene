= Introduction =

`TerseHandling` is a framework designed to _sketching_ generic input events, i.e., transforming software or hardware input events into high-level user-defined actions. It provides its own set of events which supports up to [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degrees_of_freedom_(mechanics) 6-DOFs], together with a set of *agents* which parse them, i.e., identify object *grabbers* and the *actions* they should perform, allowing the developer to focus on implementing those actions. A developer workflow would involve the following tasks:

  * Reduce (hardware or software) input events: transform inputs event into their framework counterparts.
  * Choose a callback mechanism: direct actionless approach, or high-level action-driven.
  * Define shortcut to trigger actions.
  * Implement the actions


It can be thought of a
