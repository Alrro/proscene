= Introduction =

We are happy to introduce these new *`TerseHandling`* *`ProScene2`* example sub-series.

`ProScene2` will provide two base specialized `TerseHandling` agents: `KeyboardAgent` and `GenericWheeledBiMotionAgent` together with some specialization of those. The aim of these series is to illustrate their use.

Currently, the series comprise LowLevelHandling and MouseMoveCameraRotate. More examples to come soon...
